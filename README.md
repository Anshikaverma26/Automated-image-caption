# Automated-image-caption
As a new picture-recognition challenge and an experiment in AI-driven teaching, Google published the 'Google's Conceptual Captions' dataset for image captioning. Because photos may contain a lot of information, it's critical that we develop methods for automatically and reliably producing conceptual descriptions from photographs.

The goal of this research is to combine cutting-edge techniques in computer vision and natural language processing into a single jointly-trained system that accepts images as input and provides human-readable descriptions of them.
